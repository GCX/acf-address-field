Adds an Address Field to Advanced Custom Fields. Pick and choose the components and layout of the address.

== Description ==

This is an add-on for the [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/)
WordPress plugin and will not provide any functionality to WordPress unless Advanced Custom Fields is installed
and activated.

The address field provides the ability to enter an address by component (street, city, state,
postal code, country, ...), enable or disable components, and change the layout of the
entered address (on the post screen) and printed address ( get_value() api call).

Make sure you have [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) installed and
activated. This is not a standalone plugin for WordPress, it only adds additional functionality to Advanced Custom Fields.
